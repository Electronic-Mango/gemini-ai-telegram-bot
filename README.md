# Simple OpenAI text model Telegram bot

A simple Telegram bot wrapping [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) text models (like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)), build with [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)!

Just start a conversation and all messages in the chat will be used as inputs for ChatGPT.

Conversation/context is not stored permanently and will be removed when the bot is restarted.



## Requirements

This bot was built with `Python 3.11`, [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and [`openai-python`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).
Full list of Python requirements is in the `requirements.txt` file, you can use it to install all of them.



## Configuration

Configuration is done through a `.env` file. You can copy example file `.env.example` as `.env` and fill required parameters.

```commandline
cp .env.example .env
```


### Telegram bot

Only required parameter is a [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot).

You can also restrict who can access the bot via `ALLOWED_USERNAMES`.
You can specify multiple usernames delimited by space.
If you don't want to restrict the bot at all you can remove this parameter or leave it empty.

```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN='<your secret bot token>'
ALLOWED_USERNAMES='myusername friendusername'
```


### OpenAI API

One required parameter is [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```dotenv
OPENAI_TOKEN='<your secret API key>'
```

Through `.env` you can also configure other parameters:
* `OPENAI_MODEL` - which model to use (gpt-3.5-turbo is used by default)
* `OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` - system message
* `OPENAI_CONTEXT_LIMIT` - how many messages will be kept in the context aside from prompt, all messages will be kept if empty
* `OPENAI_INITIAL_MESSAGE` - additional message added after system message to all conversations, can be empty for no additional messages

Note that `gpt-3.5-turbo` [doesn't pay strong attention to system message](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/instructing-chat-models), so changing it might not provide significant changes to responses.
You can use `OPENAI_INITIAL_MESSAGE` to tweak initial behaviour of the model.

```dotenv
OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-3.5-turbo'
OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE='You are a helpful assistant.'
OPENAI_CONTEXT_LIMIT=1000
OPENAI_INITIAL_MESSAGE='You are a helpful assistant acting like 18th century butler,'
```


## Commands

* `/start` - prints initial message returned from the model for just system message and optional initial message, doesn't impact conversation context
* `/reset` - resets current conversation and removes all context, other than system message
* `/promptset <new prompt>` - set new custom prompt, changes both system message and custom initial message (overwrites both `OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` and `OPENAI_INITIAL_MESSAGE`)
* `/promptreset` - restore prompt to default
* `/promptget` - get custom prompt, won't respond with default one to avoid leaking configuration to users
* `/promptremove` - force-remove any prompts from the conversation, including one defined in configuration files

Note that `promptset` requires to pass the new prompt as a argument, which might not work well with command menu.


## Running the bot

You can run the bot from the source code directly, or in a Docker container.


### From source code

1. Create a Telegram bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
2. Create [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. Install all packages from `requirements.txt`
4. Fill `.env` file
5. Run `main.py` file with Python


### Docker

1. Create a Telegram bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
2. Create [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. Fill `.env` file
4. Run `docker compose up -d --build` in terminal

Note that `.env` file is used only for loading environment variables into Docker container through compose.
The file itself isn't added to the container.
